(13, 13, 'OH NO! IS CONCEPT ART DYING?\r\n\r\nThe past year there has been a lot of discussion and controversy on social media about Midjourney (and similar art prompt AI‚Äôs) and its uses for generating concept art. We have been exploring these tools and, through our artist network, seen many others experiment with them too. This has resulted in exclamations such as ‚ÄúConcept art is dead!‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis is the end of concept artists!‚Äù. This begs the question: Is concept art really dying? Is our entire art niche in danger of becoming obsolete?\r\n\r\n‚Ä¶ so, is it? Well, we certainly don‚Äôt think so.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs a tool! And, as with any other tool there are pros and cons. But, with Midjourney, and similar AI art prompts, there are some contentious ways in which they are being developed and employed.\r\n\r\nThis article reflects our views on how we see AI art‚Äôs current use within the gaming industry for the purpose of creating concept art.\r\nConcept art solves problems\r\n\r\nReferring to one of my previous articles, I defined concept art as an approach to solving creative problems through art. As stated above, Midjourney is a ‚Äútool‚Äù and, as such, does not solve problems on its own. An artist or designer needs to operate and direct the tool before it is of any use. It is great for inspiration or cloud watching, trying things out and getting inspired. But it cannot make a final delivery for you. That would be malpractice.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Midjourney output as your final result, you will be pushing the workload onto the art director you are working for. They have hired you to solve their visual problems, so if you deliver an AI output and cannot explain the reasoning behind the choices made or incorporate feedback given by the art director, you have failed in your task as concept artist. The art director might as well be using this tool themselves without hiring you for it.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to my main point about AI art prompts being ‚Äújust tools‚Äù: if there is no artistic intention or interpretation behind the images, it is just a ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù machine outputting images. If the results have no culture or opinion, no ethical or otherwise meaningful and conscious consideration put into them, it is just ‚Äújunk food‚Äù. It might be fast and get you a feeling of being full. But it is empty calories with limited nutritional value.\r\n\r\nIf the purpose of concept art is solving problems, you, as a concept artist, should be able to answer the questions of ‚ÄúWhy, how, and what‚Äù of the final designs that you produce. Every aspect of your art is conscious decision. You, the artist, have consciously chosen to design your art in one way, and therefore simultaneously chosen NOT to design things in a thousand different ways. An AI art prompt will, at it‚Äôs very best, be able to answer one thing for you ‚Äì and that is: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù. It is ‚Äúwhat‚Äù you asked it to be and nothing more. ‚ÄúHow‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù will remain unanswered.\r\n\r\nSo, it is important to remember that AI Prompts are a tool among many other tools, and not a quick fix that can be used to solve problems on its own. Nor is it a threat or a substitute to concept artists, as long as the artists focuses on problem solving.\r\nWhose art is it anyway? \r\n\r\nOn Midjourney‚Äôs website you can read their Terms of Service regarding copyright:\r\n\r\n    ‚ÄúRights you give to Midjourney: By using the Services, you grant to Midjourney, its successors, and assigns a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute text, and image prompts you input into the Services, or Assets produced by the service at your direction. This license survives termination of this Agreement by any party, for any reason.‚Äù\r\n\r\nIn other words, Midjourney will get the right to use your output in their system ‚Äì no confidentiality and no discretion. Even if you come up with something unique, others can replicate it and Midjourney themselves can use it too for whichever purposes they may have.\r\n\r\n    ‚ÄúYour Rights: Subject to the above license, you own all Assets you create with the Services. This does not apply if you fall under the exceptions below.‚Äù\r\n\r\nExceptions being, not paying for the right type of user license. And even if you do own it, as stated above, so will Midjourney.\r\n\r\nOne of the most controversial uses I see, is artists posting Midjourney output on their social media and claiming it as their own creation, given they have written the prompts. The way I see it, you might as well post an image you found by searching with the right words on Pinterest. You cannot use it as your own! Pinterest or Google would probably be an even faster way to find a great image. You do not have sole ownership of the images and are infringing others‚Äô rights as well if you input ‚Äúin the style of [Artist Name]‚Äù. If you go to the Louvre and take a picture of The Mona Lisa, your photograph will be unique ‚Äì one of a kind ‚Äì but you still won‚Äôt be the creator of The Mona Lisa. You just have a nice photo of a painting. And in the world of AI Prompts, the photo will not even be yours.\r\n\r\nEven more controversial is the way in which the AI‚Äôs have been trained. The harvest of unwilling, uncredited, unpaid artwork is an atrocity. You would never grab 100 peoples hard work and do a gallery exhibition that you charge money for, without involving any of the artists. So, grabbing 5 billion images without consent to train your AI is immoral and could be considered a massive copyright infringement. \r\nThe art test\r\n\r\nWhile doing an internal art challenge at our studio, I tried using Midjourney to create my concept art. The theme of the art challenge was ‚ÄúWait, Are We the Bad Guys?‚Äù. \r\n\r\nI used this phrase as basis input for the for prompt.  After some failed attempts I found a much better reference by searching on Google. Now, I am aware that I cannot use the Google result as my own creation, but neither will I use Midjourney‚Äôs output.\r\n\r\n Admittedly, my goal here was to try to communicate an idea and not to create a beautiful piece of art. And that is the exact point, when highlighting the use of AI art for concept art! Problem solving does not necessarily need to be a high definition, polished illustrations. It CAN be a polished illustration; but 90 % of the time concept art are ideas, sketches, colour tests, and different visualizations that solves specific creative problems. \r\n\r\n On the other hand, if you are an illustrator whose actual goal it is to create a beautiful piece of artwork for a client, the issue of ownership and user rights becomes an even bigger problem for you and your client. You will need to accept the shared ownership with Midjourney, the risk of subsequent derivative use of the art your prompt produces, and potential copyright obligations to all the artwork and artists the AI has used as reference.\r\nWhat about the future? \r\n\r\nSo, what does this mean for the future of concept art? When tools to make art becomes more accessible the standard will rise, so artists must perform even better to stand out. Every time a new area of tools or methods emerges, you should learn about it, weigh out the pros and cons, and dip your feet in it, to see if it can help your workflow. If you dismiss new tools, you will fall behind. If every concept artist had dismissed photo-bashing or 3D programs (or for that sake Photoshop, back in the 90‚Äôs), relying only on what was available at the time, the current standard would be considerably lower.\r\n\r\nConcept artists whose primary value is their design skills, creative thinking, and ability to adapt new tools and methods, while critically evaluating which tools are best for the job, will become even more valuable than concept artists who can ‚Äújust‚Äù do the art.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, concept art is very far from dying. It is transitioning, though. And it will transition again and again, as it has always done. That is the essence of creative problem solving. We change our methods and approaches every time we find new tools and techniques, which makes us better and more effective as artists and creative thinkers.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a final note, I do hope that the unwilling harvest of art will become illegal practice very soon. While it might not kill concept art, it can severely damage and undermine the artists who make a living out of producing art. AI‚Äôs should compete on and uphold the same standards, practices, and copyright laws as any other artist. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy Jannick Lund, CEO, Vizlab Studios ApS', 2, '2022-11-17 05:12:28'),

(15, 15, 'TEXTURING WEAPONS: FROM \"A\"‚Äã TO \"Z\"‚Äã\r\n\r\nBlacksteinn artist Vsevolod Ushaev decided to share his method of creating realistic and high quality textures of weapons. Vsevolod focused on modern firearms and described the entire process: from basic materials to the smallest scuffs and artistic nuances. Enjoy reading ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING REFERENCES\r\n\r\nSome people underestimate this step, but it is actually the most important. We simply can not imagine in our heads, how and what is made of the weapon that we are going to move in 3D. Or rather, in theory we can, but it will be inaccurate, unreasonable and difficult to reproduce. Not to mention the details - for example, how individual parts wear out, how it \"scratches\" when dropped, how it becomes after being repaired or repainted, and so on. Our materials have to look like the real thing and have physical properties just like the real guns.\r\n\r\nWe texture in Physically Based Rendering (PBR). So the first thing we do is go into the browser and look for pictures of the gun we want in the highest possible quality. Some search engines have a high resolution search filter to avoid low-res. For example, in Bing.\r\n\r\nBut thematic refs should also be found on thematic sites. These can be online auctions, reviews from gun owners, and forums. Often you can see already shabby guns there, which is more interesting for texturing than factory shiny ones.\r\n\r\nAfter gaining a lot of refs, you should determine which one is your main reference point. This should be the most \"tasty\" picture: detailed, artistic, quality. It is important to remember one nuance: the same weapon model can be made at different times and at different factories. So carefully check the refs, otherwise you will get some absurd mess.\r\n\r\nI recommend using PureRef for storing and viewing refs. It\'s easy to group them, and you can lock the window so you always have the references in front of you.\r\n\r\nAlso, don\'t forget or be ashamed to add other artists\' work to the refboard. For example, it could be guns from the latest installments of Call of Duty or Escape from Tarkov. Of course, you don\'t need to transfer someone else\'s view - along with someone else\'s mistakes. However, there\'s nothing wrong with picking up some details in the approach of more experienced gunsmiths. Moreover, it is very useful and can inspire new work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTING UP SUBSTANCE PAINTER\r\n\r\nSubstance Painter is a modern texturing classic. Try to always work in the current version, because with updates come useful features. For example, the new Substance has the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) color profile by default. Also it is installed in Unreal Engine - so if you\'re going to import your model into Unreal, use ACES. You can put it in an old version of Painter too, here\'s a link to Gumroad. Install it as a color lut.\r\n\r\nAs HDRI I use Tomoco Studio, Soft: 1 - Front, 2 - Blacks and a slightly modified map from Studio Small 03 HDRI site - Poly Haven. While working, I advise you to switch between them periodically, because Roughness in particular looks different in different lighting.\r\n\r\nAnd be sure to set up the scene right away in the software or engine where you will present your work. This will help to quickly check how the textures will look in the final render. Unreal Engine, Marmoset Toolbag, Blender or render engines like Redshift and Octane are great. I almost always render in Marmoset - it\'s simple and handy. They\'ve added a lot of cool features in the new version, so there\'s no desire to change it for other software. Although knowledge of Unreal can be very useful to you. Of course, you will have to make some fuss with it, but you will get awesome results and at the job interview you will boast that you have experience in the game engine.\r\n\r\nWhich Pipeline to choose is up to you. It\'s best to understand both, because you might get both on a project. I was a long time afraid to try Specular/Glossiness, but in the end decided - and did not regret it. Very pleased with the ability to change the color of the glare. It gives you more control.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BASE MATERIAL AND ITS IMPORTANCE\r\n\r\nTexture creation starts with the base material. How accurately you replicate it from the reference material will determine - without exaggeration - the entire result. The scratches and chips, so beloved by many, are added at the very end and are more of a cosmetic nature. But the whole point is in the basemat.\r\n\r\nGuns are made from more or less the same materials - there are very few of them. Mostly steel, aluminum, polymer, plastic, Bakelite, wood, and anodized metals. Ideally, you should get your own library for each, so you don\'t have to create a material from scratch every time. But remember, a smart material made in Roughness/Metallic won\'t work in Specular/Glossiness. That\'s why you need to use a converter. There is one on Gumroad.\r\n\r\nTo make a basemat, find as \"clean\" a reference of your gun as possible. As if it had just come out of the factory. This can be tough, but always take the time to find a reference.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we do is create a fill layer. You don\'t want to put the slider on the extreme settings. Remember that nothing in nature is perfect black or perfect white. Immediately put noises, gradients, recessed darkening by AO, edge lightening by Curvature, and various color variations on this layer. \r\n\r\nNever do the whole gun in one color. Play with shades. Guns always look richer if there is a color breakdown on each part. You can also try overlaying some pictures with gradients of the right colors (but with a very small percentage of the transparency parameter). This way you can achieve nice shimmers, especially on metal. For example you can take a look at the work of Mykola Myhalenko from 4A Games.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s talk about noise. This is an important aspect of almost any material, because noises add to the material\'s realism. They should always be used on roughness and on color - it all depends on the material.\r\n\r\nFor the color noise, I use the default Color Sum map for Painter. I advise you to try all the blending options and play with transparency. The important thing is that the noise should not stand out. Its mission is to work on the general feeling. In addition, it is better to use several noises at different scales.\r\n\r\nThere is classic White Noise for overlaying noise in the other channels. Moreover, it has contrast options, which gives you more flexible settings for different tasks. Also, nobody forbids using ready-made maps with correct PBR parameters from Quixel as a base.\r\n\r\nTo summarize this section: never leave the base material blank. Often newbies make one fill - and immediately start adding damage. Sit on the basemat for a while longer, play with it. Remember: it\'s the foundation of the whole model.\r\n\r\nTHE ROUGHNESS CHANNEL\r\n\r\nNow let\'s move on to another important parameter: roughness. If we create a model for the first-person game, then every time the player turns, there should be glare on the weapon. And whether they will be nice or not depends on the roughness.\r\n\r\nOn the ArtStation, you can often see noisy, shallow, dirty roughness that is unpleasant to look at. How to avoid it? There is a 70/30 rule - the accent distribution rule. Never overlay a grunge texture you like on an entire model. Preferably, draw accent spots by hand using a flatbed. That way you can more accurately transfer what you see on the ref to the model.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT ARTISTIC COMPONENT\r\n\r\nIn 3D, there is a parameter of artistry. And if a 3D artist should go to art school, it is only to better understand this parameter. The artistic eye helps to make the work not boring. You need to be able to control the viewer\'s gaze, to guide him through the rendering, focusing on important details. If you just repeat the reference, you won\'t get that. I include color, contrast, accents, strokes, as well as the relationship between elements in the concept of artistry.\r\n\r\nAlways look at the references carefully. You\'ll find interesting and memorable elements that will add personality to your work.\r\n\r\nArtistry is very difficult to learn. In classical courses, there is almost no attention to it. But I will mention a few sources that helped me personally to pump up this parameter:\r\n\r\n    Stream on CG Allies about weapons (russian)\r\n    ArtOfSoulburn channel\r\n    Igor Dyatlov\'s Streams and Draft Punk 2019 Course (russian)\r\n    Evgenii Park\'s streams and Hard Surface course (russian)\r\n    Alex senechal Visual Design Basics course\r\n\r\nAlso in 3D, knowledge from related fields such as concept art, engineering, industrial design is very helpful.\r\n\r\nFor example, as a not-so-great example of artistry, consider... One of my works, the Walther P38 pistol. There are no accents here. If I were to do it now, in addition to my only points of attraction - chips on height, I would add oil stains, dust or a more interesting roughness. The crumpling on the magazine is also an element that adds interest, but deformation has to be handled very carefully, given the properties of the particular metal.\r\n\r\nDAMAGE\r\n\r\nDamage is anything that happened to the gun during use:\r\n\r\n    chips\r\n    scuffs\r\n    dirt\r\n    paint defects\r\n    dust\r\n    scratches\r\n\r\nTo accurately recreate them, you will need the appropriate texture maps, generators and alphas. There are enough generators in Painter, but alphas are something you will have to look for. Often the authors of texture courses leave such stuff behind. Or look for damage packs on ArtStation.\r\n\r\nYou probably know about the Metal Edge Wear generator in Painter. Often beginner artists, ignoring the refs, apply it to the whole model - and leave it that way. Don\'t do that. Generators are highly conspicuous and show that this is exactly what a 3D model is. I mean, that\'s not how it works in life. I don\'t mean to say that generators are bad. On the contrary, if you approach the process with your head and know how to use generators in moderation, they become an indispensable tool. For example, do not be afraid to brush over places where generators have not worked well.\r\n\r\nIn general, never be afraid of manual work. There are a lot of good texture brushes in Substance. So, if you are doing some beat up rifle with peeling paint, you won\'t be able to just paint over the texture of the worn off paint - all the flaws will immediately catch the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SUM IT UP\r\n\r\nNever stop learning. Watch the tutorials and try out new pipelines. There are plenty of cool tutorials, including free ones.\r\n\r\nAnd remember: even the best textures can be ruined by rendering with bad lighting. \r\n\r\nIf you\'ve read to this point, give it a like!

I\'m currently working on my next big concept art post for my Fountain of Souls: The S√§gs floater world.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sky of the Salt lands, and the world of Od‚Äô by an extent, is populated by billions upon billions of airborne beings called ‚Äúfloaters‚Äù. These silent living things come in many shapes and sizes: from the size of a hand to some as big as cathedrals, they offer a wonderful spectacle of colorful bioluminescence along with regular deadly lightning storms.\r\n\r\nIt is in the western pans, in between the Astalai city and the Nelouan region, drifts the biggest one of all. Called the Floater-world, the behemoth is like a center of gravity for its other smaller peers, as well as the life source for this fragile ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe S√§gs are the self proclaimed protector of that said equilibrium. Inhabiting between the warm and humid epidermis folds, these daring people have left the ground to live ever closer to their sky gods and to run away from certain destruction from many more powerful foes. Now they reign supreme and unchallenged over the salt lands for well over a millenia‚Ä¶ Who controls the sky, controls the ground. \r\n\r\nInitial concepts of the floater world I\'ve done back in 2020.

I like the idea that the Floater-world is a VERY old living thing that has went through many hurdles.

(20, 19, 'Developing Speed in 3D Art\r\n\r\n1.Intro\r\n\r\nIn this post I‚Äôm going to go over some of my general thoughts and philosophy when it comes to speed in 3D art.  All the usual caveats apply - I‚Äôm not any kind of ultimate dispenser of sacred knowledge. I‚Äôm just a silly little guy. But I do think I have something valuable to say here.Let‚Äôs define things a little here. What do I even mean by speed? Well, that should be fairly obvious - the amount of time it takes you to complete an asset, character or environment. \r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this post I‚Äôll make the clarification that I‚Äôm not talking about rushing things, being hasty. Sacrificing quality in order to get things done is something you have to often do in production, but it‚Äôs not a desirable state of being. \r\n\r\nThough perhaps there‚Äôs a point to be made here about knowing when something is good enough and knowing where to cut corners.\r\n\r\nIt might be more helpful to use the term Efficiency. But I‚Äôll stick with speed for this post. \r\n\r\n\r\n2. Speed - Does it matter?\r\n\r\nYes. But no actually. As with all things in art and life, it depends! \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you‚Äôre more of a beginner or in the early stages of your 3D art training I would say simply don‚Äôt worry about speed. It‚Äôll come eventually. This applies to a large chunk of people in the ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù category as well. Don‚Äôt worry about it! Speed is mostly a measure of experience. And you‚Äôll almost inevitably develop it over time along with your other skills. However, there can certainly be cases where you‚Äôre able to produce quality work but at such a slow pace that it can hinder your project/job/career. Perhaps you‚Äôve noticed that your work is just as good as your peers, but you get there slower than you‚Äôd like? \r\n\r\n3. How do you get faster?\r\n\r\nI would argue that speed is mainly a direct measure of experience. Of course things don‚Äôt always correlate perfectly and there are edge cases.\r\n\r\nExperience isn‚Äôt linear. No matter how experienced you are, if you‚Äôre learning something brand new you won‚Äôt be blazing fast at the start. \r\n\r\nSo what does this mean? I think Speed is only meaningful in the context of production and when creating assets for which you have a standardized pipeline. RnD and other exploratory work don‚Äôt really follow the same rules. Experience can be further split up into two rough categories - I‚Äôll call these the macro and micro levels:\r\n\r\nMacro level means knowing what you want to achieve and how to get there. Having great artistic fundamentals, a trained eye and a good overall idea of what the process will look like from beginning to end. Micro level is the moment-to-moment work inside your 3D package. This is about knowing your program and all the various tricks you can use to speed up your work. In broad terms, Macro level stuff is not something I or anyone can teach - certainly not in a single blog post. It‚Äôs years of accumulated knowledge from various sources and deliberate practice. Though perhaps I can help guide your thinking in the next section.\r\n\r\nMicro level on the other hand can be quite easily taught - it‚Äôs every quick YouTube tutorial you‚Äôve ever googled about how to use a specific feature in a program.  But the challenge there is accumulating enough of this knowledge in bits and pieces until you‚Äôve mastered whatever program you‚Äôre working in. \r\n\r\n4. How to think about art production\r\n\r\nPlan well, reuse smartly, don‚Äôt waste time on things no one will see. Pipeline first!As boring as it may sound, I think the best way to get consistently faster is by having a solid plan at the start and standardizing as much of your process as possible into repeatable and predictable chunks and trusting the process. \r\n\r\nBy approaching art production from a pipeline-first perspective, you can more easily reuse work, resources or techniques, and make better estimates about how long something will take you. The latter can be incredibly important in a production setting. \r\n\r\nYou should always be on the lookout for things to improve your workflows. I invite anyone who‚Äôs read this far to take a good look at your day-to-day processes in whatever software you use and question whether you‚Äôre doing things in the most optimal way possible. The answer is very likely no. \r\n\r\nI certainly don‚Äôt. So everyone‚Äôs got room to improve. But there‚Äôs a slight contradiction here: I‚Äôm advocating for standardization while also saying you should be improving and thus changing up your methods all the time. So what gives? \r\n\r\nI think it‚Äôs important to recognize that there‚Äôs a tension between those two aspects of our work. \r\n\r\nMost of the time I resolve this by incorporating small changes to my workflow immediately, and larger ones I evaluate between projects or at the start of a new one. Certainly be very wary of changing anything that affects the final look of your assets if you‚Äôre in the middle of a project. I want to stress not being hasty just for the sake of speed again. Doing sloppy work will most likely mean redoing things and you end up spending way more time on things in the end. \r\n\r\nAnd again, a lot of this comes down to just plain old experience. The best way to get faster is to get those reps in. Make 3D art. Over and over. Every day.\r\n\r\nGet a few hundred props under your belt and you‚Äôll have a much better idea about how long something will take, and will probably be able to describe in detail exactly how you‚Äôd execute an asset just by looking at the concept. Same goes for characters, environments etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you‚Äôve made enough assets, everything can be seen as just a remixing of things you‚Äôve already made. This is how human brains work - we contextualize new things based on lived experience. After a while most new assets are just a mash-up of techniques you‚Äôve already used in previous ones. \r\n\r\nAnd even slightly more abstract aspects of art like composition and color can be remixed and reused!  \r\n\r\n5. Software-specific methods\r\n\r\nIn this section I‚Äôll discuss software-specific tips and tricks, but still start with generalizations.\r\n\r\nThis might make some people mad but I‚Äôm a huge advocate for keybinds. Pressing keyboard shortcuts is significantly faster than clicking through menus. Pie menus are a halfway point and can be nice, but only if they aren‚Äôt bloated with too many options and you memorize them so you can quickly flick to whichever option you want. \r\n\r\nThe difference between near-instantaneous keypresses and clicking through menus may not feel like much but it adds up over time. However! I will point out that this is the microest of micro-improvements when it comes to speed. Experience on the macro level usually has a much larger effect on speed. A master painter is able to do with a few brush strokes what an amateur needs hours of noodling for, no matter how fast the amateur moves their brush. So, my recommendation is to look for actions that you find yourself repeating often and keybinding as many of those as possible. I try to do this in every program if possible. Similarly, you should look for things to automate and standardize whenever possible. Standardize your master materials in Unreal, or reuse parts of them in future projects. Standardize your texture export presets in Substance. Figure out a reliable and efficient import-export pipeline between all of your programs so you never get any surprises. Have a mental checklist for all the things you need to do on every asset and make sure to go through those every time. Or even better, automate all of that. Congratulations! You‚Äôre a pipeline tech artist. \r\n\r\nSo, let‚Äôs talk about poly modeling. Specifically in Blender. This isn‚Äôt a tutorial about any specific techniques, but here‚Äôs some stuff I find helpful.\r\n\r\nIn my view the most important thing you can do is to improve the way you do selections. Selecting the elements you want quickly and reliably is, to me, at the core of becoming a good modeler. Selecting what elements you want to do an operation to is always the first step in any operation.That‚Äôs why I recommend getting familiar with, and eventually adding shortcuts to, all the advanced selection options found here in the Select menu:\r\n\r\nSelect similar (Shift-G) is also incredibly powerful and can help you a ton in making quick selections.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend making use of the LoopTools addon, specifically the Relax, Circle and Space options. These give you loads of freedom to always alter topology after creating it, so you can focus more on form and less on specific edge loop counts. Especially handy for retopology.Speaking of retopo, make sure to enable the F2 addon. This, in combination with Grid Fill and the tools above will massively speed up your retopology work. \r\n\r\n\r\n6. Summary\r\n\r\nSpeed comes mostly from experience. Beginners should not worry about speed - quality comes first. Knowing what they want to achieve and how to get there is the primary way experienced artists are able to work fast. Though micro-level speed improvements such as shortcuts can help too. You should always be looking to create steady production pipelines for yourself in order to be able to standardize your asset creation methods and share techniques and resources across assets and projects. You should constantly be on the lookout for new ways to improve your workflows. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!', 2, '2022-11-17 05:54:51'),

I‚Äôm a very passionate and hard working archviz artist.\r\n\r\nWith a background in creating game environments, I‚Äôm able to setup optimized archviz scenes using realtime render engines.\r\n\r\nI currently work as a VR and AR designer at Van Wijnen. Here I develop photoreal real-time experiences, for customers that are looking to buy unbuilt property. Visualising property helps customers making better desccions when buying their future home. VR enables to see build property on a 1:1 scale.\r\n\r\nOn the side I help people develop their skill in real-time archviz, sell products through my ArtStation store and develop tutorials for artstation learning.\r\n\r\nMy long term goal is to push the archviz industry towards using real-time game engines. By pushing my own quality on a daily base, I want to show the possibillity an engine like Unreal Engine 4 has. It greatly increases render time, allows for instant changes in material and is able to setup multiple innovative tours within hours. This all can be done with clients to receive immediate feedback!\r\n\r\nIn my free time I Love to travel the world and explore the many diffrent cultures the world has to offer. I photograph all the places I come to feed my creativity and create amazing memories!', 'album_cover_16.jpg'),
